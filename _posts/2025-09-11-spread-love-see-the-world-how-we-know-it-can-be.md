Recent events have left me reflecting on how far we've drifted from being able to simply coexist with people who think differently than us. What happened in the last 24 hours—and really, what's been building over the past couple of years—shows a troubling reality: we've become so polarized that we can't live with each other anymore.

It's heartbreaking to see that people can no longer handle the fact that others have different opinions, beliefs, political affiliations, religions, or identities. This shouldn't be how things are. As human beings, we should be able to hold our own convictions while respecting the perspectives of others, regardless of our differences.

## The Technology Problem

Part of me wonders if social media and technology aren't largely to blame for this shift. The widespread broadcasting of hateful language and the ease with which negativity spreads online have fundamentally changed how we interact. Many years ago, I don't recall this level of polarization, even though negative, vocal people have always existed throughout human history.

The difference is that back then, negative voices weren't widely broadcast because—let's face it—people don't typically want to be around negativity. But when that negative activity is constantly in your face online, something dangerous happens. You start wanting to feel good about opposing it, so you jump to the totally opposite side and essentially breed your own type of negativity by becoming a polarizing force in the other direction.

This cycle is destroying our ability to appreciate the differences each person brings and to learn from one another.

## A Different Path Forward

That's exactly why we're building what we're building at Retrosquare. We're creating software and services that help people appreciate the unique contributions everyone brings to the table. We want to foster environments where people can learn from each other and become better because of the lessons and insights others have shared with them.

Take our upcoming project, Praiseworthy, which we hope to launch soon. This tool allows people to send genuine praise and goodness to others without seeking acknowledgment for themselves. It's not about looking good or earning extra credit points—it's about expressing genuine gratitude and thanks. We need more of this in our lives.

When we practice authentic gratitude and positivity, we feel happier and more hopeful. That's what the world desperately needs right now: positivity and love for one another. Not because we're all the same and share identical beliefs and opinions, but because we're all different and can learn, grow, and teach each other through positive interactions.

## Living Our Mission

At Retrosquare, we believe the internet should be a realm of friendliness, goodwill, and wholesome activity. We know that each individual can make a difference through their best efforts to be kind online. This isn't just our mission statement—it's a response to the very problems plaguing our digital world today.

We believe we are who we are because of those who have gone before us, and we have the power to shape future generations through our decisions, actions, and influence. When we choose to build technology that brings out the best in people rather than amplifying their worst impulses, we're actively working toward a better future.

Our commitment to creating deliberately wholesome applications, games, and services isn't naive idealism—it's a practical response to a real problem. Wholesome entertainment allows our minds to rest from our labors while enriching our lives and relationships with friends and loved ones.

## The Choice Is Ours

Every day, we make choices about what kind of digital world we want to create and inhabit. We can continue down the path of polarization, where different opinions become threats and disagreement becomes grounds for hatred. Or we can choose to build spaces where diversity of thought is celebrated, where kindness is prioritized, and where technology serves to connect rather than divide us.

At Retrosquare, we're choosing the latter. We're building for a world where different isn't dangerous—it's beautiful. Where technology amplifies our capacity for goodness rather than our tendency toward division.

The internet doesn't have to be a battleground. It can be a place of learning, growth, and genuine human connection. That's the world we're building toward, one wholesome application at a time.

*Onward, ever onward!*
